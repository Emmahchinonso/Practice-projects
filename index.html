            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>Rolihlahla Mandela was born into the Madiba clan in the village
                of Mvezo, in the Eastern Cape, on 18 July 1918. His mother was
                Nonqaphi Nosekeni and his father was Nkosi Mphakanyiswa Gadla
                Mandela, principal counsellor to the Acting King of the Thembu
                people, Jongintaba Dalindyebo. In 1930, when he was 12 years
                old, his father died and the young Rolihlahla became a ward of
                Jongintaba at the Great Place in Mqhekezweni1.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>1934-1949</strong> to gain skills needed to become a
                privy councillor for the Thembu royal house, in 1933 Mandela
                began his secondary education at Clarkebury Methodist High
                School in Engcobo, a Western-style institution that was the
                largest school for black Africans in Thembuland.[25] Made to
                socialise with other students on an equal basis, he claimed that
                he lost his "stuck up" attitude, becoming best friends with a
                girl for the first time; he began playing sports and developed
                his lifelong love of gardening.Mandela began studying law at the
                University of the Witwatersrand, where he was the only black
                African student and faced racism. There, he befriended liberal
                and communist European, Jewish, and Indian students, among them
                Joe Slovo and Ruth First.[52] Becoming increasingly politicised,
                in August 1943 Mandela marched in support of a successful bus
                boycott to reverse fare rises.[53] Joining the ANC, he was
                increasingly influenced by Sisulu, spending time with other
                activists at Sisulu's Orlando house, including his old friend
                Oliver Tambo.[54] In 1943, Mandela met Anton Lembede, an ANC
                member affiliated with the "Africanist" branch of African
                nationalism, which was virulently opposed to a racially united
                front against colonialism and imperialism or to an alliance with
                the communists.[55] Despite his friendships with non-blacks and
                communists, Mandela embraced Lembede's views, believing that
                black Africans should be entirely independent in their struggle
                for political self-determination</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>1950–1954</strong>:Mandela took Xuma's place on the ANC
                national executive in March 1950, and that same year was elected
                national president of the ANCYL. In March, the Defend Free
                Speech Convention was held in Johannesburg, bringing together
                African, Indian, and communist activists to call a May Day
                general strike in protest against apartheid and white minority
                rule. Mandela opposed the strike because it was multi-racial and
                not ANC-led, but a majority of black workers took part,
                resulting in increased police repression and the introduction of
                the Suppression of Communism Act, 1950, affecting the actions of
                all protest groups. At the ANC national conference of December
                1951, he continued arguing against a racially united front, but
                was outvoted.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>1955-1961</strong>:After taking part in the unsuccessful
                protest to prevent the forced relocation of all black people
                from the Sophiatown suburb of Johannesburg in February 1955,
                Mandela concluded that violent action would prove necessary to
                end apartheid and white minority rule.In December 1956, Mandela
                was arrested alongside most of the ANC national executive, and
                accused of "high treason" against the state. Held in
                Johannesburg Prison amid mass protests, they underwent a
                preparatory examination before being granted bail.</p>

              <li>
                <p><strong>1962-1964</strong>:On 5 August 1962, police captured
                Mandela along with fellow activist Cecil Williams near
                Howick.[131] Many MK members suspected that the authorities had
                been tipped off with regard to Mandela's whereabouts, although
                Mandela himself gave these ideas little credence.[132] In later
                years, Donald Rickard, a former American diplomat revealed that
                the Central Intelligence Agency, who feared Mandela's
                associations with communists, had informed the South African
                police of his location.[133][134] Jailed in Johannesburg's
                Marshall Square prison, Mandela was charged with inciting
                workers' strikes and leaving the country without permission.
                Representing himself with Slovo as legal advisor, Mandela
                intended to use the trial to showcase "the ANC's moral
                opposition to racism" while supporters demonstrated outside the
                court.[135] Moved to Pretoria, where Winnie could visit him, he
                began correspondence studies for a Bachelor of Laws (LLB) degree
                from the University of London International Programmes.[136] His
                hearing began in October, but he disrupted proceedings by
                wearing a traditional kaross, refusing to call any witnesses,
                and turning his plea of mitigation into a political speech.
                Found guilty, he was sentenced to five years' imprisonment; as
                he left the courtroom, supporters sang "Nkosi Sikelel iAfrika".</p>

              <li>
                <p><strong>president of South Africa 1994-1999</strong>:The newly
                elected National Assembly's first act was to formally elect
                Mandela as South Africa's first black chief executive. His
                inauguration took place in Pretoria on 10 May 1994, televised to
                a billion viewers globally. The event was attended by four
                thousand guests, including world leaders from a wide range of
                geographic and ideological backgrounds.[241] Mandela headed a
                Government of National Unity dominated by the ANC—which had no
                experience of governing by itself—but containing representatives
                from the National Party and Inkatha. Under the Interim
                Constitution, Inkatha and the National Party were entitled to
                seats in the government by virtue of winning at least 20 seats.
                In keeping with earlier agreements, both de Klerk and Thabo
                Mbeki were given the position of Deputy President</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>In December 1994, Mandela published Long Walk to Freedom, an
                autobiography based around a manuscript he had written in
                prison, augmented by interviews conducted with American
                journalist Richard Stengel.[251] In late 1994, he attended the
                49th conference of the ANC in Bloemfontein, at which a more
                militant national executive was elected, among them Winnie
                Mandela; although she expressed an interest in reconciling,
                Nelson initiated divorce proceedings in August 1995.[252] By
                1995, he had entered into a relationship with Graça Machel, a
                Mozambican political activist 27 years his junior who was the
                widow of former president Samora Machel. They had first met in
                July 1990 when she was still in mourning, but their friendship
                grew into a partnership, with Machel accompanying him on many of
                his foreign visits. She turned down Mandela's first marriage
                proposal, wanting to retain some independence and dividing her
                time between Mozambique and Johannesburg</p>

              <li>
                <p><strong>Withdrawal from politics</strong>The new Constitution of South Africa was agreed upon by
                parliament in May 1996, enshrining a series of institutions to
                place checks on political and administrative authority within a
                constitutional democracy.[304] De Klerk opposed the
                implementation of this constitution, and that month he and the
                National Party withdrew from the coalition government in
                protest, claiming that the ANC were not treating them as
                equals.[305] The ANC took over the cabinet positions formerly
                held by the Nationalists, with Mbeki becoming sole Deputy
                President.[306] Inkatha remained part of the coalition,[307] and
                when both Mandela and Mbeki were out of the country in September
                1998, Buthelezi was appointed "Acting President", marking an
                improvement in his relationship with Mandela.[308] Although
                Mandela had often governed decisively in his first two years as
                President,[309] he had subsequently increasingly delegated
                duties to Mbeki, retaining only a close personal supervision of
                intelligence and security measures.[310] During a 1997 visit to
                London, he said that "the ruler of South Africa, the de facto
                ruler, is Thabo Mbeki" and that he was "shifting everything to
                him".[309] Mandela stepped down as ANC President at the party's
                December 1997 conference. He hoped that Ramaphosa would succeed
                him, believing Mbeki to be too inflexible and intolerant of
                criticism, but the ANC elected Mbeki regardless.[311] Mandela
                and the Executive supported Jacob Zuma, a Zulu who had been
                imprisoned on Robben Island, as Mbeki's replacement for Deputy
                President. Zuma's candidacy was challenged by Winnie, whose
                populist rhetoric had gained her a strong following within the
                party, although Zuma defeated her in a landslide victory vote at
                the election.[312]</p>

              <li>
                  <p><strong>Retirement 1994-2004</strong>Retiring in June 1999, Mandela aimed to lead a quiet family life, divided between Johannesburg and Qunu. Although he set about authoring a sequel to his first autobiography, to be titled The Presidential Years, it was abandoned before publication.[317] Mandela found such seclusion difficult and reverted to a busy public life involving daily programme of tasks, meetings with world leaders and celebrities, and—when in Johannesburg—working with the Nelson Mandela Foundation, founded in 1999 to focus on rural development, school construction, and combating HIV/AIDS.Publicly, Mandela became more vocal in criticising Western powers. He strongly opposed the 1999 NATO intervention in Kosovo and called it an attempt by the world's powerful nations to police the entire world.[326] In 2003, he spoke out against the plans for the US and UK to launch a war in Iraq, describing it as "a tragedy" and lambasting US President George W. Bush and UK Prime Minister Tony Blair for undermining the UN, saying, "All that (Mr. Bush) wants is Iraqi oil".[327] He attacked the US more generally, asserting that it had committed more "unspeakable atrocities" across the world than any other nation, citing the atomic bombing of Japan; this attracted international controversy, although he later improved his relationship with Blair</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                  <p>in June 2004, aged 85 and amid failing health, Mandela announced that he was "retiring from retirement" and retreating from public life, remarking, "Don't call me, I will call you."[331] Although continuing to meet with close friends and family, the Foundation discouraged invitations for him to appear at public events and denied most interview requests.</p>

                  <p>After suffering from a prolonged respiratory infection, Mandela died on 5 December 2013 at the age of 95, at around 20:50 local time (UTC+2) at his home in Houghton, surrounded by his family</p>
